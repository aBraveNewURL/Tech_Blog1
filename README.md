## Challenge 14: Model-View-Controller (MVC)
This exercise is our cohort's 14th challenge centering on implementing the MVC model, starting with the introduction of Handlebars to our projects.
## Installation
Several packages are used in this assignment. After cloning the repository, simply run `npm i` to install the needed modules. Next, you'll need to start up the database with `mysql -u root -p` followed by your password. Run `source db/schema.sql;` to import the schema, confirm that we're using the correct DB with `use tech_blog;`. Lastly, run `npm start` to bring up the rest of the application!
## Usage
Once started, the application will present a simple home screen with login and register features
